## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.2] - 2025-01-02

### Fixed - Addon Discovery Issue üîç
- **Added Required Icon Files**: Generated `icon.png` (128x128) and `logo.png` (250x100) from SVG sources for proper addon store display
- **Fixed Mapping Format**: Corrected `config.yaml` to use proper `homeassistant_config:rw` syntax instead of complex type/read_only format
- **Updated .gitignore**: Removed PNG icon exclusions to allow required addon files to be committed

### Technical Details
- The missing `icon.png` file was preventing the addon from appearing in Home Assistant addon store search results
- Fixed file system mapping configuration to match official Home Assistant addon standards
- All configuration validation checks now pass successfully

This patch release specifically addresses addon discoverability issues in the Home Assistant store.

## [0.2.1] - 2025-01-02
