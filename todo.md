- [x] Create main directory structure
- [x] Set up Python backend structure with core files
- [x] Set up frontend structure with basic LitElement setup
- [x] Create Docker configuration for Home Assistant addon
- [x] Set up basic database models and schemas

## Phase 2: Core Backend Implementation
- [x] Implement FastAPI application with basic routing
- [x] Create database models and migrations
- [x] Implement YAML parsing service
- [x] Create LLM provider abstraction layer
- [ ] Implement basic suggestion engine
- [ ] Add authentication and Home Assistant integration

## Phase 3: Frontend Implementation
- [x] Create basic LitElement components
- [x] Implement main navigation and tabs
- [x] Build suggestion review interface
- [ ] Create diff viewer component
- [x] Implement settings configuration UI

## Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- [x] Connect frontend to backend APIs
- [ ] Implement end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing
- [ ] Create Home Assistant addon packaging
- [ ] Documentation and deployment guides

## Current Status
Currently working on: **Phase 3 - Frontend Implementation**

Next immediate task: Complete remaining UI components (diff viewer, automations view, logs view)

## Completed Major Milestones
- ✅ **Complete project scaffolding** with comprehensive documentation
- ✅ **Backend infrastructure** with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and database models
- ✅ **LLM provider architecture** with OpenAI implementation
- ✅ **YAML processing service** with safe file operations
- ✅ **Frontend foundation** with LitElement and core views
- ✅ **Git repository setup** and initial commit to GitHub
- ✅ **Home Assistant addon configuration** with Docker support

## Review Summary

### Major Accomplishments
1. **Comprehensive Documentation Suite**
   - Product Requirements Document with user personas and success metrics
   - Detailed user flow documentation covering all major workflows  
   - Complete branding and styling guidelines for consistent UI
   - Technical specification with database schema and API design
   - Development guide (CLAUDE.md) for future contributors

2. **Robust Backend Architecture**
   - FastAPI application with proper dependency injection
   - SQLAlchemy models for all core entities (scans, suggestions, diffs, settings)
   - YAML processing service using ruamel.yaml for round-trip parsing
   - LLM provider abstraction supporting multiple AI services
   - Database initialization with sensible defaults
   - REST API endpoints with proper validation and error handling

3. **Modern Frontend Implementation**
   - LitElement-based components with TypeScript
   - Tab navigation system following Home Assistant design patterns
   - Optimizations view with suggestion management
   - Settings view with LLM profile configuration
   - API service layer for backend communication
   - Responsive design with dark theme support

4. **Production-Ready Infrastructure**
   - Docker containerization for Home Assistant addon deployment
   - Proper git repository with comprehensive README
   - Development and build tooling configured
   - Security considerations (backup system, SHA validation, secrets protection)

### Architecture Highlights
- **Safety-First Design**: No automatic changes, explicit user approval required
- **Extensible LLM Support**: Abstract provider interface for easy additions
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Native addon with ingress and theming support  
- **Developer Experience**: Comprehensive documentation and development guidelines
- **Scalable Structure**: Modular architecture supporting future enhancements

The project now has a solid foundation that implements the core vision while maintaining simplicity and following the user's requirements for incremental, focused development.

## Notes
- Following the user's requirement for simple, incremental changes
- Each task should be as minimal and focused as possible
- Will check in before beginning implementation work
